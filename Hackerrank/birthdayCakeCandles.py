# You are in-charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for
# each year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest
# ones.
# For example, if your niece is  4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 3,2 ,1 ,3 , she
# will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candle is of height 3 and there are 2 such
# candles.
