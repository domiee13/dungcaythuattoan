# Looks like your little brother doesn't want to remember the multiplication table! Instead he wants to play videogames all day long. To teach him a lesson you'd like to write a virus that will pop up in the middle of the game and disappear only when the brother correctly solves several math questions.

# To begin with, you need to construct a multiplication table. Given an integer n, return the multiplication table of size n Ã— n.

# Example

# For n = 5, the output should be

# multiplicationTable(n) = [[1, 2,  3,  4,  5 ], 
#                           [2, 4,  6,  8,  10], 
#                           [3, 6,  9,  12, 15], 
#                           [4, 8,  12, 16, 20], 
#                           [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]]

def multiplicationTable(n):
    return [[x*y for x in range(1,n+1)] for y in range(1,n+1)]#vong lap long nhau
